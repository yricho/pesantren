  })
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Bills Not Generated Automatically
- Check cron job configuration
- Verify `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
- Check bill type configuration (must be recurring and active)
- Review application logs

#### 2. Payment Verification Issues
- Ensure user has proper permissions (ADMIN, STAFF)
- Check payment status (must be PENDING)
- Verify bill exists and is not already paid

#### 3. Grade-specific Pricing Not Working
- Check bill type's `priceByGrade` JSON format
- Ensure student's grade field matches exactly
- Verify fallback to institution type pricing

#### 4. Sibling Discounts Not Applied
- Check parents have matching phone numbers
- Verify bill type has sibling discount enabled
- Ensure `allowSiblingDiscount` is true

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Database Indexing
Ensure these indexes exist for optimal performance:
```sql
-- Bills
CREATE INDEX idx_bills_student_status ON bills(student_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_bills_type_period ON bills(bill_type_id, period);
CREATE INDEX idx_bills_due_date ON bills(due_date);

-- Payments
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_verification ON bill_payments(verification_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_date ON bill_payments(payment_date);

-- Students
CREATE INDEX idx_students_phones ON students(father_phone, mother_phone);
```

#### 2. Caching Strategy
- Cache bill types (rarely change)
- Cache dashboard statistics (update every 15 minutes)
- Cache payment method configurations

## Security Considerations

### 1. File Upload Security
- Validate file types (images and PDFs only)
- Limit file size (max 5MB)
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store files outside web root

### 2. Payment Verification
- Always require admin verification for online payments
- Log all payment activities
- Implement rate limiting for payment submissions
- Validate payment amounts against bill amounts

### 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive financial data
- Log access to payment information
- Implement role-based access controls
- Regular backup of payment data

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Monthly**: Review outstanding bills and send reminders
2. **Quarterly**: Analyze payment patterns and adjust policies
3. **Annually**: Update bill types and pricing
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor payment verification queue
